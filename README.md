Predicting and Forecasting Cocoa Futures Prices Using Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning.

## Overview
- This project is motivated by the real world problem of the market price volatility cocoa pries experience due to factors such as climate conditions, geopolitical events, supply chain disruptions, and global demand fluctuations.

- This project aims to create a model using time series analysis and machine learning that accurately predicts and forecasts cocoa futures prices for informed decision-making for farmers and chocolate production companies who rely on accurate pricing for decision making. 

- This project predicts cocoa futures prices by using historical price data trends from the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) and climate data (temperature and precipitation) from Ghana provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). By improving price forecasting prediction accuracy, this project supports economic stability in cocoa-producing regions.

## Data
- Cocoa futures prices (1994–2025) – International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)  
- Ghana climate data (temperature, precipitation) – NCEI

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- ARIMA, GARCH models
- Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
- Machine Learning Models (Random Forest, Gradiant Boosting Machine)

## Results
- Forecasts the continued rise in prices thorugh the Random Forest model
